The dataset contains information about subway stations in NYC with a
wide range of variables: line, station name, station latitude and
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. It has 1868 rows and 19 columns.

These data are not tidy because there are many repeating observations:
there are multiple entries for the same station (e.g., 25th St and 36th
St) with different entrance locations, which creates redundancy. The
dataset also has multiple route columns (Route1, Route2, etc.), but not
all rows have data for every route. This results in a wide data
structure where many cells are empty.

- **Data Import:** `read_csv()` was used to import the CSV file into R
  as a tibble.
- **Column Cleaning:** `janitor::clean_names()` was applied to clean and
  standardize the column names.
- **Column Selection:** `select()` was utilized to choose specific
  columns from the dataset and organize them in the desired order.
- **Data Transformation:** `mutate()` and `ifelse()` were used to
  convert `entry` variable from character type (YES and NO) to logical
  variable (TRUE and FALSE). The columns `route8` to `route11` were
  converted to character variable to maintain consistency with other
  route columns.

``` r
distinct_stations = distinct(nyc_subway_df, station_name, ada)
total_distinct_stations = nrow(distinct_stations)
ada_compliant_stations = nrow(filter(distinct_stations, ada == TRUE))

no_vending = filter(nyc_subway_df, vending == "NO")
total_no_vending = nrow(no_vending)
allow_entrance = nrow(filter(no_vending, entry == TRUE))
proportion_allow_entrance = round(allow_entrance/total_no_vending, 3)
```

There are 381 distinct stations. 73 stations are ADA compliant. The
proportion of station entrances without vending that allow entrance is
0.377.

``` r
nyc_subway_tidy = 
  pivot_longer(
    nyc_subway_df,
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name"
  ) |>
  drop_na(route_name)

``` r
a_train_stations = 
  nyc_subway_tidy |>
  filter(route_name == "A") |>
  distinct(station_name, ada)

total_a_train = nrow(a_train_stations)

a_train_ada = 
  a_train_stations |>
  filter(ada == TRUE) |>
  nrow()
```

The A train serves 57 different stations. Of the stations that serve the
A train, 16 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)),
         trash_wheel_name = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
         year = as.integer(year))
```

``` r
professor_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("./trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
             range = "A2:M108",
             na = c("")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trash_wheel_name = "Professor Trash Wheel",
         year = as.integer(year))
```

``` r
gwynnda_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("./trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", 
             range = "A2:L157",
             na = c("")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trash_wheel_name = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
         year = as.integer(year))
```

``` r
combined_trash_wheel = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel, gwynnda_trash_wheel)
```

This dataset documents the collections from various trash wheels
(Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda) over distinct time
periods. It consists of 844 x 15 and includes comprehensive quantitative
data that highlights:

- **Weight and Volume (`weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards`):**
  Detailed metrics on the total weight and volume of waste collected by
  each trash wheel.
- **Composition Analysis (`plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, etc):** A
  breakdown of the materials found in each dumpster, including specific
  categories such as plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarettes, and other
  waste types.
- **Energy Metrics (`homes_powered`):** It also includes information on
  the energy generated from the waste collected, measured in kilowatts
  (kW).

``` r
total_weight_professor = 
  professor_trash_wheel |>
  pull(weight_tons) |>
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)

june2022_cigarette_gwynnda = 
  filter(gwynnda_trash_wheel, month == "June", year == 2022) |>
  pull(cigarette_butts) |>
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26.
The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022
is 18120.
